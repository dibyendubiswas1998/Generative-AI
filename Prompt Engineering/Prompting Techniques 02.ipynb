Data warehouses provide:\n    1. **Consolidated View:** Integrate data from multiple sources into a single, consistent view, eliminating data silos.\n    2. **Historical Data Tracking:** Store historical data over long periods, enabling trend analysis and performance tracking.\n    3. **Improved Data Quality:** Implement data cleansing and transformation processes to improve data accuracy and consistency.\n    4. **Enhanced Performance:** Optimized for analytical queries, providing faster access to insights.\n    5. **Support for BI Tools:** Designed to work with BI tools, enabling users to easily access and analyze data.\n\n* **Pros:**\n    1. **Better Business Intelligence:** Data warehouses provide a foundation for effective BI and data-driven decision-making.\n    2. **Improved Data Quality:** Data cleansing and transformation processes lead to more accurate and reliable data.\n    3. **Enhanced Performance:** Optimized for analytical queries, resulting in faster report generation and analysis.\n    4. **Historical Analysis:**  Allows for trend analysis and identification of patterns over time.\n    5. **Consolidated View of Data:** Provides a single source of truth for the entire organization.\n\n* **Cons:**\n    1. **Complexity and Cost:** Building and maintaining a data warehouse can be complex and expensive, requiring specialized skills and resources.\n    2. **Data Latency:** Data warehouses are not real-time systems; there is a delay between data updates and availability for analysis.\n    3. **Limited Flexibility:** Data warehouses are typically designed for specific analytical purposes and may not be flexible enough to adapt to changing business needs.\n    4. **Data Governance Challenges:** Ensuring data quality, consistency, and security can be challenging in a data warehouse environment.\n    5. **Over-reliance on IT:**  Business users may become overly reliant on IT for data access and analysis.\n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["response = chain2.invoke(\"Hi,How are you?\")\n","display(Markdown(response))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":64},"id":"M4_0XMGV73sU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1734075212638,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1766,"user":{"displayName":"Dibyendu Biswas.","userId":"13544031185281536447"}},"outputId":"eb70cb7d-43c0-4354-fdde-ab1aad70bccf"},"execution_count":76,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Hi!
