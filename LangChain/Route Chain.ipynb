It’s a mechanism for organizing and managing the execution of different actions or processes, often in a conditional or branching manner, ensuring that the right operations are applied to the right data or queries.<br><br>\n","\n","**Overview of Route Chain:**<br>\n","* **Definition:** A Route Chain is a structured sequence of tasks or processes that are executed conditionally based on the input data or specific criteria. It allows for dynamic and flexible task management by routing data through different chains depending on its characteristics or the desired outcome.\n","\n","* **Purpose:** The main goal of a Route Chain is to provide a way to handle complex workflows and conditional logic within a LangChain system. It enables the model to determine the best path for data processing or task execution based on the given inputs.\n","\n","* **mportance:** Route Chains are crucial for creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient workflows in LangChain applications. They allow for modular and adaptable design, making it easier to handle diverse tasks and data types without hardcoding the logic for each possible scenario.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","**Key Components of a Route Chain:**<br>\n","* **Input:** The data or query that initiates the chain. The input can be text, a question, a request for data, etc.\n","\n","* **Router:** The component that decides which chain to follow based on the input. The router uses predefined criteria or conditions to determine the appropriate path.\n","\n","* **Chains:** These are sequences of tasks or steps that process the input. Each chain represents a different path or workflow that the input can take.\n","\n","* **Output:** The final result or response produced after the input has traversed through the selected chain.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","**Example of a Route Chain - 01:**<br>\n","**Scenario:** Suppose you have an AI system that can handle both customer service queries and technical support requests. A Route Chain can be used to determine whether to route the query to a customer service agent or a technical support specialist based on the content of the query.<br>\n","\n","1. **Input:** A user query such as \"I need help with my order\" or \"How do I reset my password?\"\n","\n","2. **Router** Analyzes the query to decide which type of support is needed. For example, it can use keywords or intent detection to categorize the query.\n","\n","3. **Chains:**\n","  * **Customer Service Chain:** Handles queries related to orders, billing, and general customer service issues.\n","\n","  * **Technical Support Chain:** Handles queries related to technical issues, such as password resets, software problems, or hardware troubleshooting.\n","\n","4. **Output:** The system provides a relevant response or action, such as connecting the user to a customer service agent or providing instructions for resetting a password.\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","**Process Flow:**<br>\n","* **Step 1:** The user submits a query: \"How do I reset my password?\"\n","* **Step 2:** The router examines the query and identifies the keyword \"reset\" and \"password.\"\n","* **Step 3:** Based on these keywords, the router directs the query to the **Technical Support Chain**.\n","* **Step 4:** The Technical Support Chain retrieves relevant information or instructions for password reset and sends the response back to the user.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","\n","**Example of Route Chain - 02:**\n","**Example Scenario:** Consider a healthcare application where patients can inquire about general health advice or request specific information about their medical records. A Route Chain can be used to manage these two types of requests efficiently.<br>\n","\n","1. **Input:** A patient's query, such as \"What are the symptoms of diabetes?\" or \"I need a copy of my latest blood test results.\"\n","\n","2. **Router:** The router analyzes the input to determine if it's a request for general health advice or for personal medical records.\n","\n","3. **Chains:**\n","  * **Health Advice Chain:** Provides information or advice based on medical knowledge and data.\n","\n","  * **Medical Records Chain:** Processes requests related to personal medical records and accesses the necessary data.\n","\n","4. **Output:** The system provides the appropriate response, either general health information or specific medical records.\n","<br>\n","\n","**Detailed Flow:**<br>\n","* **Step 1:** The user inputs the query: \"What are the symptoms of diabetes?\"\n","* **Step 2:** The router detects keywords like \"symptoms\" and \"diabetes\" indicating a general health query.\n","* **Step 3:** The router routes the query to the Health Advice Chain.\n","* **Step 4:** The Health Advice Chain retrieves information on diabetes symptoms and formulates a response.\n","* **Step 5:** The system outputs: \"The symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue.\"\n","<br><br>\n","\n","**For another query:**<br>\n","* **Step 1:** The user inputs: \"I need a copy of my latest blood test results.\"\n","* **Step 2:** The router detects phrases like \"copy\" and \"blood test results,\" indicating a personal records request.\n","* **Step 3:** The router routes the query to the **Medical Records Chain.**\n","* **Step 4:** The Medical Records Chain accesses the user's medical records and retrieves the latest blood test results.\n","* **Step 5:** The system outputs: \"Your latest blood test results have been sent to your registered email address.\"\n","<br><br>\n","\n","**Conclusion:**<br>\n","**Route Chains** in LangChain provide a structured and dynamic way to manage complex workflows and conditional logic, ensuring that data or tasks are routed through the most appropriate processing paths. This enhances the system’s capability to handle diverse queries efficiently and effectively, making it an invaluable tool in modern AI applications.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"d2k1tiISKf9C"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Example 01:**"],"metadata":{"id":"pANFKQOQSHzm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# install necessary libaries:\n","\n","!pip install sentence_transformers -qU\n","!pip install langchain langchain_community chromadb pypdf langchain_google_genai -qU"],"metadata":{"id":"4U-8eD1rCaeY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","from langchain.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate\n","from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain\n","from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain\n","from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser\n","from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE\n","from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI\n","from google.colab import userdata"],"metadata":{"id":"bOVZqEIPCagb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Write prompts for destination Chains:**"],"metadata":{"id":"AEu9nHl0Sst8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Write different prompts for performing different tasks:\n","\n","python_code_prompt='''You can do coding only and only in python.
