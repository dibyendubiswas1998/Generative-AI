The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new \\r\\nuser interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds.\\r\\nThe technology, it should be noted, is not brand-new. Generative AI was introduced in the 1960s in chatbots. But it \\r\\nwas not until 2014, with the introduction of generative adversarial networks, or GANs -- a type of machine learning \\r\\nalgorithm -- that generative AI could create convincingly authentic images, videos and audio of real people.\\r\\nGenerative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are designed to generate new content or \\r\\ndata rather than simply analyzing or recognizing existing patterns. These systems have the ability to create new and \\r\\noriginal outputs, such as images, text, music, and more, based on patterns and knowledge learned from a dataset \\r\\nduring the training phase.\\r\\nOne popular type of generative AI is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs consist of two neural networks \\r\\n– a generator and a discriminator – that are trained together in a competitive manner. The generator generates \\r\\nsynthetic data, and the discriminator evaluates whether the generated data is real or fake. Through this adversarial \\r\\ntraining process, the generator improves over time, creating outputs that become increasingly difficult for the \\r\\ndiscriminator to distinguish from real data.\\r\\nGenerative AI has been applied in various fields, including image synthesis, text generation, style transfer, and even \\r\\nin creating realistic deep fake videos. While generative AI has shown remarkable capabilities, it also raises ethical \\r\\nconcerns, particularly regarding the potential misuse of the technology for creating deceptive or malicious content. \\r\\nResearchers and developers are actively working on both advancing the capabilities of generative AI and addressing \\r\\nits ethical implications.\\r\\nWhere Generative AI exists.:\\r\\n● Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence\\r\\n● Deep Learning is the subset of Machine Learning\\r\\n● Generative AI is the subset of Deep Learning \\n')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["file_path_2 = \"/content/k6_social_science_1.pdf\"\n","loader = PyPDFium2Loader(file_path_2)\n","social_science_documents = loader.load()"],"metadata":{"id":"kh6ZJryLlvOi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719985197994,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1193,"user":{"displayName":"Dibyendu Biswas.","userId":"13544031185281536447"}}},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(social_science_documents)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HLpbahAElvRc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719985201416,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":457,"user":{"displayName":"Dibyendu Biswas.","userId":"13544031185281536447"}},"outputId":"d55deccb-fd0e-4303-d464-ae79de7bfb17"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["110"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["social_science_documents[0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hIPViztRlvUG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719985203848,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Dibyendu Biswas.","userId":"13544031185281536447"}},"outputId":"a697564c-6154-46ee-aaa1-20775881bd34"},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Document(metadata={'source': '/content/k6_social_science_1.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content='1 \\uf06e\\r\\nintroduction: what, \\r\\nwhere, how and when?\\r\\nFinding out what happened\\r\\nYesterday: you could listen to the radio, watch \\r\\ntelevision, read a newspaper.\\r\\nLast year: ask somebody who remembers.\\r\\nBut what about long, long ago?
